
# Setup

* To avoid having to restart codesyscontrol manually you can run:
```
echo "$USER ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart codesyscontrol" |
sudo EDITOR="tee" visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/allow_restart_codesyscontrol
```
This will allow the command `systemctl restart codesyscontrol` to be run with sudo without having to enter your password.


# Limitations

* Strings not supported
* Must not change the node name as the update script searches for a '.../robin' node
* Must have bash (devel/setup.bash)
* User must belong to sudo group
* Must restart codesyscontrol

* Strings and arrays with fixed size only (STRING[] defaults to 80 in CODESYS)


# TODOs

* think simplify templated classes by templating only specific functions
  * search difference between templating functions and classes
  * search templating member functions without templating classes
  * think if applies

* add support for strings and arrays
  * implement strings/arrays manually
    * function to simplify array copy
  * update.py: update templates (files and constants) and logic to handle strings/arrays
  ? update.py: add check for strings function; only specialize template if strings are present in struct

* pass DEF_ARRAY_SIZE to robin fb
* check all combinations (no msgs, ros msgs, custom msgs, X both ros and custom msgs)
* review isOpen logic
* ros: pass node nodehandle to robin objects
* unit tests
    * sem/shm read/write list of values
* integ tests
* different error codes
* readme
* compare performance with old version
* optimize performance
    * reduce isOpen checks if performance worse than old version
    * reduce ifs, loops
    * time tests
    * ? replace std::string with char*
    * pass by ref or val?
    * is read thread faster than old way? (specially in beagle; can it handle it?)
* update.py: move template constants to file

## Later
* scan network before updating
    * get project children (device), get gateway, get targets, sel target, set comm path
    * OR get gateways, sel gateway, get targets, sel targets, set comm path
* start_update.py: export specified project instead of primary
    * if no arg and no primary, error
* config to publish on change only (eg {attrib...)
* support robin objects from external POUs/GVLs
* update.py: update source files only if changed
* update.py: check if source updates were successful
* support ros services
* support ros actions
* allow choosing to zero or keep unsent values in variable length arrays

## Maybe
* remove ros console from shm and sem classes
* update.py: print 'Updating...' and pause inside
* encapsulate everything in class(es): RobinUpdateStarter, RobinUpdater
* detect shell used to compile
* ros side as service as well
* single shm space
* start_update.py: config.yml for ssh settings
* update.py: config.yml for sudo settings
* change header files to .hpp extension
* change inst.cpp to impl.cpp
* use macros to automate struct member assignments based on structs.h
* put all RobinPublishers into one thread
* allow different publishing/reading rates
